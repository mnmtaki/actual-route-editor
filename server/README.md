# ARA Java backend — accounts and cloud saves

Java 21 / Spring Boot / Spring Security / PostgreSQL / Flyway.

## Local launch
Create the `actual_route` PostgreSQL database and a database user. Set
`DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_USER`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD`,
`ARA_CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173`, and `ARA_COOKIE_SECURE=false`
for HTTP-only local development. Then run `mvn spring-boot:run` from server/.
Run the editor with `npm run dev` from repository root.

Production MUST use HTTPS, `ARA_COOKIE_SECURE=true` and one trusted
`ARA_CORS_ORIGIN`. Cookies use host-only scope, SameSite=Lax, path=/.
The browser uses credentials: include and sends X-ARA-CSRF for writes.
The HttpOnly session cookie is never exposed to JavaScript, and neither
bearer tokens nor credentials are stored in localStorage. Refreshing the page
restores the login via GET /api/auth/me. Sessions expire after 7 days;
logout deletes the server token.

## Routes
POST /api/auth/register — username and password
POST /api/auth/login — sets HttpOnly ara_session + readable ara_csrf cookie
GET /api/auth/me — returns userId while the cookie is valid
POST /api/auth/logout — revokes session, clears cookies
GET /api/projects — user's projects
POST /api/projects — create project
GET /api/projects/{uuid} — load
PUT /api/projects/{uuid} — require expectedRevision for atomic CAS save
DELETE /api/projects/{uuid} — delete

## Safeguards
- Password hashes use BCrypt. Session tokens are generated using SecureRandom;
  the database stores only SHA-256 hashes.
- Unsafe requests are checked with X-ARA-CSRF matched against a CSRF cookie
  and a per-session SHA-256 hash in PostgreSQL. Browser Origin, if sent,
  must match the configured trusted frontend origin.
- PostgreSQL-backed fixed-window throttling: login 8 attempts per username
  per 15m and 50 per remote IP per 15m; register 5 per IP per hour.
  Remote IP is taken directly from the socket: do not place the service
  behind an untrusted proxy; configure proxy source IP handling separately.
- All project queries are scoped by authenticated owner_id. Version conflicts
  return HTTP 409 without overwriting a newer save.

## Boundaries
- Cloud saves remain opt-in and do not replace browser IndexedDB saves.
- This version does not include password recovery, multi-device management,
  email verification, saved revision history, collaboration or automatic syncing.
- CSRF cookie is JS-readable by design; its session binding in PostgreSQL
  prevents arbitrary cookie spoofing. XSS prevention still matters.
- Configure a trusted proxy, API request size limits and cleanup for expired
  session/rate-limit rows before a public deployment.
